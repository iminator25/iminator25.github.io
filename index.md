## About Me

I am a student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) studying Computer Science and Physics. The Computer Science department at UBC is ranked 1st in Canada and 16th globally. I am set to Graduate in May 2020. 

I was born in Calgary, AB, raised in Greenville, SC then pursued Undergraduate studes in Vancouver at UBC.  

## Projects

#### DNS Lookup 
A service that was made with Java. This program takes in input such as "lookup www.google.com" from the command line and can display information about what server path the information you are receiving came through. More information about [DNS servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). 

The Example output that I recieved for my website is: 
```
post example output here 
```
Utilized: Wireshark, Java, linux, TCP, UDP, DNS

#### Reaper Route - [Vancouver Decode Congestion Hackathon](https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/decode-congestion-hackathon.aspx)
A service that takes in the mode of transportation that a user desires, start and destination locations, and outputs a route that is as safe as possible. This information was obtianed by using City of Vancouver traffic API and plotting how many accidents have happend on a specific route that the user would have initially taken given from google maps, then finds a new safe quick route as recomended by our algorithm.

Utilized: Heroku, JavaScript, Python, Google Cloud API, CoV traffic API

#### [SleepSweet](https://devpost.com/software/sleep-sweet) - [NorthWest Hackathon 2020](https://www.nwhacks.io/)
A hardware software combination that allows users to track thier sleep cycles as well as acts as an alarm clock. The main goal of this device is to allow people to not have their phone next to them while they sleep. This comes with a webpage that allows users to visulize different patterns in thier sleep. Check out the Devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/sleep-sweet)
