## About Me

I am a student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) studying Computer Science and Physics. The Computer Science department at UBC is ranked 1st in Canada and 16th globally. I am set to Graduate in May 2020. 

I was born in Calgary, AB, raised in Greenville, SC then pursued undergraduate studies in Vancouver at UBC.  

## Projects

#### DNS Lookup 
A service that was made with Java. This program takes in input such as "lookup www.google.com" from the command line and can display information about what server path the information you are receiving came through. More information about [DNS servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). 

The Example output that I recieved for my website is: 
```
post example output here 
```
Utilized: Wireshark, Java, linux, TCP, UDP, DNS

#### Reaper Route - [Vancouver Decode Congestion Hackathon](https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/decode-congestion-hackathon.aspx)
A service that takes in the mode of transportation that a user desires, start and destination locations, and outputs a route that is as safe as possible. This information was obtianed by using City of Vancouver traffic API and plotting how many accidents have happend on a specific route that the user would have initially taken given from google maps, then finds a new safe quick route as recomended by our algorithm.

Utilized: Heroku, JavaScript, Python, Google Cloud API, CoV traffic API

#### SleepSweet - [NorthWest Hackathon 2020](https://www.nwhacks.io/)
A hardware software combination that allows users to track thier sleep cycles as well as acts as an alarm clock. The main goal of this device is to allow people to not have their phone next to them while they sleep. This comes with a webpage that allows users to visulize different patterns in thier sleep. Check out the Devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/sleep-sweet)

Utilized: React Native, Arduino, C, JavaScript, Python, Standard Library

## Interests

#### Machining

I enjoy making tools that I need and am just curious about. Below are a couple of things I have made using mainly Lathes, Drill presses, and welding. The next project is a homemade espresso machine that vastly improves on the concept of the moka pot. Plans will be posted here as soon as they are finished. 

#### Outdoor Activities

Outside time is mandatory when living in a place like Vancouver BC. Seeing the views this place to offer is a lot of fun. Here are some pics of cool places.
