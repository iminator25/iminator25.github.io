## About Me

I am a graduate from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) where I studied Computer Science and Physics. The Computer Science department at UBC is ranked 1st in Canada and 16th globally.

Currently living in Austin, TX

I was born in Calgary, AB, raised in Greenville, SC then pursued undergraduate studies in Vancouver at UBC.  

## Projects

#### DNS Lookup 
A service that was made with Java. This program takes in input such as "lookup www.google.com" from the command line and can display information about what server path the information you are receiving came through. More information about [DNS servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). 

The Example output that I recieved for my website is: 
```
DNSLOOKUP> lookup www.iminator25.github.io

#### Reaper Route - [Vancouver Decode Congestion Hackathon 2019](https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/decode-congestion-hackathon.aspx)
A service that takes in the mode of transportation that a user desires, start and destination locations, and outputs a route that is as safe as possible. This information was obtianed by using City of Vancouver traffic API and plotting how many accidents have happend on a specific route that the user would have initially taken given from google maps, then finds a new safe quick route as recomended by our algorithm. The Devpost is [here](https://devpost.com/software/sleep-sweet-uqtnox)

Utilized: Heroku, JavaScript, Python, Google Cloud API, CoV traffic API

#### SleepSweet - [NorthWest Hackathon 2020](https://www.nwhacks.io/)
A hardware software combination that allows users to track thier sleep cycles as well as acts as an alarm clock. The main goal of this device is to allow people to not have their phone next to them while they sleep. This comes with a webpage that allows users to visulize different patterns in thier sleep. Check out the Devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/sleep-sweet)

Utilized: React Native, Arduino, C, JavaScript, Python, Standard Library

#### [Johnson Noise Physics Paper](./Imey_s_Lab_1_Report.pdf)
This paper was written in an upper year Physics labratory. The focus of the paper was to charecterize Johnson Noise; a phenomenon that occurs in all circuts. It is a residuial noise in an electrical circuit that can affect very sensitive electronics. In order to detect the noise, a custom amplifier was built and python data analysis tools were used. Please note that the introduction to this paper includes some fictional information purely for delivery of the paper. 

Utilized: Python, Circuit Design, Fast Foruier Transformations, Data Analysis

## Interests

#### Machining

I enjoy making tools that I need and am just curious about. Below are a couple of things I have made using mainly Lathes, Drill presses, and welding. I currently work with JC Welding on the evenings creating custome steel fabrications for customers in Austin, TX. 



#### Outdoor Activities

Outside time is mandatory when living in a place like Vancouver BC. Seeing the views this place to offer is a lot of fun. Here are some pics of cool places.
