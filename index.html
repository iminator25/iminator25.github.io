<p>
I am interested in investing, robotics, software development, machining, security, and outdoor activities.  
</p>

<h3> Here are couple examples projects</h3>

Making an app that tracks every aspect of my life, helping me adjust things I do in my life allowing me to be the most productive. This was inspired by <a href= "https://imgur.com/5zop8mn"> this</a>  post I saw on reddit. 

<h3> Investing ideas and certifications</h3>

Day trading is engaging on the weekends and even though I dont make money I dont spend a much. This is more of a way to learn how to properly invest and spend money. Working on the Bloomberg Investing certification offered by UBC Sauder school of business. This is an interesting way to learn the "correct" ways to invest. I am not complete it yet but will post a pic of certificate when I am. 
<h3> Robotics </h3>

Ideas for Robotics include entering in the Canada Microsoft AI challange, aiming to make a robot that moves in two planes and quickly removes non compostoable material from compostable material moving on a conveyer belt. Although this project did not get selected to move on, it was an interesting way to learn how computer skills can help our society/enviornment. 

<h3>Software Development</h3>

School projects are fun however they are not usually on things I want to to be doing. 

Participating in the Decode Congestion Hackathon was a great way for me to imporve my javascript skills dramatically and it was fun to work on a project that was not school related. 
<h3> Machining </h3>

I enjoy making tools that I need and am just curious about. Below are a couple of things I have made using mainly Lathes, Drill presses, and welding. 

The next project is a homemade espresso machine that vastly improves on the concept of the moka pot. Plans will be posted here as soon as they are finished.

<h3>Outdoor Activities</h3>

Outside time is mandatory when living in a place like Vancouver BC. Seeing the views this place to offer is a lot of fun. Here are some pics of cool places.

I like to find solutions to everyday problems my friends and I have, usually to make our lives just a little bit easier. Programming and robots are great tools for this.
